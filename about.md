There really isn't much to say about me or this blog. I've found I like to write and so I've started this blog here. I like tinkering with electronics, I consider it the ultimate battle between getting something to work and not letting the magic smoke out. As much as I like messing with electronics I'm by no means an engineer or anywhere near an expert in any one field.

I do have a great deal of experience in many other pursuits in life, some of which you'll find on this blog, others not so much.
I began in electronics in middle school, taking my amateur radio exam at the age of 14. I passed the technician exam my first try and missed the general knowledge test by 1 question the first go. The first go on the code also saw me with just a blank sheet of paper but I was able to finally nail down the code and for some reason didn't sit for the knowledge test again. I waiting almost the full year, believe before retaking the knowledge test and passing it. You'll see some radio stuff here for sure.

In high school I began my assault on computers. I studied computer communications in high school but never pursued it as a career, choosing instead, the military. While that might sound like a noble decision, it wasn't really all that noble and was kind of just "ah okay lets give this a shot, it looks like fun". Ironically, I do nothing with computers in the military.

They say politics is one of those things you never talk about... we'll see how long I can go...

I guess the rest I just plan on figuring out as I go. I've been doing a bunch of projects lately around my new house and just getting into getting some radio stuff going so I hope you'll stick around for the ride, maybe see me let that magic smoke out after all!
