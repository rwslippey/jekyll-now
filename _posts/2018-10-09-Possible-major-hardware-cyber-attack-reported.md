title: Possible hardware cyber attack reported by Bloomberg
---
These articles are always scary to see especially when you use these services everyday but the real fear here might just be the perpetrators of this attack.

[Bloomberg recently reported](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2018-10-04/the-big-hack-how-china-used-a-tiny-chip-to-infiltrate-america-s-top-companies) the well known server motherboard manufacturer supermicro might have supply chain security issues and the results could be catastrophic. The report explains how a small chip was found on several boards across several companies. The chip allows the hacker to gain access to and launch an attack on networks utilizing these hardware boards. 

The real concern is where these boards were manufactured and who is possibly behind the attack, China.

Today [Bloomberg reported new evidence of hacked hardware found](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-09/new-evidence-of-hacked-supermicro-hardware-found-in-u-s-telecom). 30 companies are claimed to be compromised and where these boards have been used is equally expansive including sensitive locations.

Stay tuned as I update this post with more info this evening.
